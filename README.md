========

TYPO3 CMS extension to display Flickr galleries; this is work in progress.

The pictures are served directly from Flickr - the format of thumbnail and lightbox image can be selected in the Plugin configuration.

The Flickr apiKey must be inserted in the TypoScript Constants; the static template must be included.

The plugin comes unstyled (ATM).
